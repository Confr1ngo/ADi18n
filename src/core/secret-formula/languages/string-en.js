Enabling the Battery Saver disables the Newsticker. If you wish to enable the Newsticker you need to disable Battery Saver and then choose \"News\" in Options - UI - Top bar. What is better: Antimatter Galaxy or Dimension Boost? \t\t\tGalaxy is always better. How does the Antimatter Galaxy work? \t\t\tEvery Tickspeed purchase makes your Antimatter Dimensions 1.1245x faster. If you purchase a Galaxy, every Tickspeed purchase will make your Antimatter Dimensions 1.1445x faster.

Every tick will give the player production equal to the tick's length followed by the player's autobuyers buying if they can, repeated until all of the offline progress is simulated.\t\t\tThe maximum amount of offline ticks can be increased in the Options from 1000 (which is the default value) up to 1 million ticks. Doing so will make autobuyers buy more often when offline, making the offline progress closer to online progress, up to 14 hours of accurate progress with 1M ticks in contrast to 50 seconds of accuracy with 1000, with the drawback being having to wait longer after opening the app to finish the simulation.\t\t\tWhen you press \"Speed up\" during the offline simulation the remaining progress is simulated with at most 1000 ticks.",

  "htp_offline_progress": "\t\t\tAntimatter Dimensions has a catch-up mechanic which attempts to simulate the game's behavior if the game is closed for an extended period of time. The simulation behavior is only somewhat accurate, as the game is too mathematically complicated to be run at full accuracy in a reasonable amount of time. At the end of the simulation, the game will summarize how various relevant resources have changed while you were gone. \t\t\tThe game runs on a system where everything is updated once per tick - all Dimensions and resources do one unit of production, all Autobuyers trigger once, all multipliers and values are changed accordingly, and all the displayed numbers are updated. There are normally 40 ticks per second when the game is running, although lag and internal Android behavior may cause tick length to vary by a few milliseconds. \t\t\tWhen offline simulation is active, these ticks have an adjusted length in order to fill the amount of time you were away - for example having a setting for 1000 offline ticks and closing the game for an hour will result in ticks which are 3.6 seconds long each. For most things in the game, this is not an issue because this will still result in approximately the same amount of resources after the simulation completes. A notable exception is Autobuyers - in this situation Autobuyers will effectively only trigger once every 3.6 seconds, which may have a strong impact depending on the part of the game. \t\t\tOffline tick count can be adjusted between 1000 and 1'000'000 ticks. Smaller counts will result in faster but less accurate simulations, while larger counts will result in more accurate simulations which take longer to complete. \t\t\tOffline progress can be disabled entirely if desired, for example for diagnostic or timing purposes, or in order to do an online only playthrough of the game. Otherwise, offline progress is on by default from the very beginning of the game.

Rather than producing something else, Replicanti actually produces itself up to a maximum of 1.80e308. Replicanti are produced at their own pace, unaffected by Tickspeed upgrades. Each individual Replicanti has a certain chance (initially 1%) of producing another Replicanti every Replicanti interval (initially every second), and both of these can be upgraded by spending IP. \t\t\tWhen Replicanti reach 1.80e308 you can exchange them for a Replicanti Galaxy. This Galaxy acts in the same way as an Antimatter Galaxy - it increases the effectiveness of your Tickspeed upgrades, but it will not make your next Antimatter Galaxy more expensive. The amount of Replicanti Galaxies you can have is capped (upgradable). \t\t\tTip: You can hold the \"Reset replicanti amount\" button to buy Replicanti Galaxies faster. \t\t\tChance upgrade cost: Base 1e150 IP, cost increment 1e15x per upgrade \t\t\tInterval upgrade cost: Base 1e140 IP, cost increment 1e10x per upgrade \t\t\tGalaxy upgrade cost: Base 1e170 IP, cost increment 1e25x and an additional 1e5x per upgrade, scaling similarly to Distant Antimatter Galaxies.

These Tickspeed upgrades are kept on Infinity, but reset every Eternity. \t\t\tSimilarly to the other dimensions, 2nd Time Dimensions produce 1st Time Dimensions and so on. Similarly to Infinity Dimensions, your production will be reset to the amount you purchased after every Eternity, but you will keep any upgrades to your multipliers you purchased. \t\t\tEach purchase increases the multiplier of that specific Time Dimension by ×4. The cost multiplier between upgrades has a base value, but is increased by ×1.5 at 1.80e308 EP and ×2.2 (of the base value) at 1e1300 EP. These increases apply retroactively, causing the cost to jump when they reach those thresholds, and only apply to the first four dimensions. Beyond 1e6000 EP each dimension purchase counts as four purchases for the purpose of cost increases, causing the price to rise much more steeply. \t\t\tEach threshold to gain another Tickspeed upgrade is 33% more Time Shards than the previous, or 25% with the relevant time study. After 400,000 upgrades, the multiplier between each successive free Tickspeed upgrade will gradually increase at a rate of ~×1.35 per 50,000 upgrades (×1.000006 per upgrade). \t\t\tTime Dimension base costs (EP): 1, 5, 100, 1e3, 1e2350, 1e2650, 1e3000, 1e3350 \t\t\tTime Dimension base cost increases: 3, 9, 27, 81, 2e4, 7e4, 2e5, 7e5",
